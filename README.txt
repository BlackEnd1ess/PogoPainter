This Project will simulate the Crash Bash (Playstation1 2002), Minigame: Pogo Painter.

Rules in orginal Game:

4 Players will jump in the Arena to paint the Block below the own Player. Any painted block will
append 1 block. If you Hit a Crate with as example 4 painted Blocks, then you will earn 4 Points.
To Solve this Game you need to collect the most Points before the Time is up.

Difficulty is: Other Players can destroy your painted Blocks by over painting.
